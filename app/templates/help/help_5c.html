    Hints on transfers
</h6>

<p class="left-align">
    Since there is no opportunity to undo a transfer when it is created, it is advised to create "correction" categories from both type, and use them in need of correct a pocket balance.
    <br>It is advised to keep the number of categories low as possible, and add details to transfers to keep the money-flow clear and informative.
    <br>It is advised to add the transfers as soon as possible since the timestamp of the transfers are created automatically when they are registered, and there is no opportunity to modify them later.
    <br>It is also advised to provide details anywhere to keep the pockets, categories and transfers clear and informative.
